Small intro to php for teammates:

Functions cannot be overloaded, though there is a methods to overcome this, but we don't need it at this day and age.

Variable types are not declared explicitly. (You don't write int $myInteger = 5 , but just write $myInteger = 5)
Type conversions are made automatically by assignment (just use = sign, I guess it turns out that everything is a reference in PHP)

Any other notes are welcomed
